# Modulation Classification Using CNNs under AWGN and Fading Channels

This project provides a MATLAB-based framework for generating datasets and evaluating modulation classification performance under **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)** and **Rayleigh Fading** channels based on the paper 10.1109/IS61756.2024.10705195. It includes data generation, signal modulation, channel modeling, feature extraction, and accuracy plotting for various deep learning models (e.g., SAEDNN, HTDN, Single CNN).
